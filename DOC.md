# General Software Architecture

## Events

Each instance of lan-mouse can emit and receive events, where
an event is either a mouse or keyboard event for now.

The general Architecture is shown in the following flow chart:

    A[Wayland Backend] -->|WaylandEvent| D{Input}
    B[X11 Backend] -->|X11Event| D{Input}
    C[Windows Backend] -->|WindowsEvent| D{Input}
    D -->|Abstract Event| E[Emitter]
    E -->|Udp Event| F[Receiver]
    F -->|Abstract Event| G{Dispatcher}
    G -->|Wayland Event| H[Wayland Backend]
    G -->|X11 Event| I[X11 Backend]
    G -->|Windows Event| J[Windows Backend]
```

### Input
The input component is responsible for translating inputs from a given backend
to a standardized format and passing them to the event emitter.

### Emitter
The event emitter serializes events and sends them over the network
to the correct client.

### Receiver
The receiver receives events over the network and deserializes them into
the standardized event format.

### Dispatcher
The dispatcher component takes events from the event receiver and passes them
to the correct backend corresponding to the type of client.


## Requests

// TODO this currently works differently

Aside from events, requests can be sent via a simple protocol.
For this, a simple tcp server is listening on the same port as the udp
event receiver and accepts requests for connecting to a device or to
request the keymap of a device.
